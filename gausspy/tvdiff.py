#         
# ISSUES:  
#          These issues are still under active development:
#            (1) Code does not keep track of "dx" spacings
#            (2) For alpha approaching 0.0, the code does not
#                return the original naive finite-difference derivative.
#            (3) Native support for higher-order derivatives
#            (4) Shell (command line) operation
#
#
# DESCRIPTION: 
#          Total-variation Tikhonov regularized numerical 
#          differentiation of 1D data.
#
#          This Python code was adapted from the MATLAB routine of 
#          Rick Chartrand (rickc@lanl.gov) presented in: 
#          Chartrand 2011, "Numerical differentiation of noisy,nonsmooth data," 
#          ISRN Applied Mathematics, Vol. 2011, Article ID 164564 following the
#          algorithm from Chapter 8 in "Computational methods for 
#          Inverse Problems" by Curtis R. Vogel.
